## How it works

Simplified is this project just a counter, which speed can be changed, combined with animations for a 7-segment display, which also can be switched trough.

## How to test

The default setting should display the numbers 0 to 9, which should change every second. The design can be tested by pressing the different input buttons and seeing if the speed respectively the animation changes.

## External hardware

You might need a breadboard and buttons for the controls, as well as a 7-segment display if not available.
